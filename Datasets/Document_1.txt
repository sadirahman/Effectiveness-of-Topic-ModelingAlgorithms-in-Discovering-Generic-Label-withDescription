Traffic jam means a long line of vehicles that can not move or that can move very slowly. It is a common affair in the big cities of our country. There are many causes of traffic jam. Rapid growth of population and the increasing amount of vehicles are the main causes 
Vehicles are much more than the roads can accommodate. The indiscriminate playing of rickshaw is another causes of it. Haphazard parking of vehicles alongside the pavement also causes of it. 
Violation of traffic rules is also responsible for it. The drivers do not follow traffic rules. Traffic jam causes untold sufferings to people. Sometimes it raises our mental tension. It causes loss of our valuable time. We have to wait to reach our destination. 
The students, the office-going people, the businessmen and the patients in the ambulance are the worst sufferers of it. Traffic jam can be removed by enforcing traffic jam strictly. 
The narrow roads should be broadened. By pass roads should be constructed in the big towns. One way movement of vehicles and building of fly over can solve this problem. We can reduce it by raising public awareness.
